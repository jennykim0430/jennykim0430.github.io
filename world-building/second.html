	Why You Should Care? </h1>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h2 style="text-align: right;">
		Have you ever noticed that <br>people are proud to tell you they rescued their dog? <br>
		<br>

	</h2>

			They should be proud; rescuing a dog in need saves the life of an animal, and is both rewarding and the right thing to do.<br>
			When you choose to adopt, you save the life of one of the many wonderful dogs who are waiting in rescues and<br>
			shelters for someone to love them, and make room for another animal to be saved. <br>
			Dogs of every age, breed, size, and temperament are waiting to be adopted,<br>
			 from purebreds to mutts, puppies to seniors, and everything in between.<br>
			 Most people who consider buying their new pet from a breeder or a pet store <br>
			 don't realize the magnitude of the animal overpopulation problem in our country. <br>
			 Tragically, over 1.5 million unwanted animals are euthanized in the US every year. <br>
			 These are mostly healthy, loving pets whose former owners have let them down by failing to<br>
			 accept responsibility for their care, and choosing not to spay or neuter.<br>

			The biggest misconception about rescued dogs is that they are somehow damaged or deficient,<br>
			 but they are just as loving and loyal as any dog, and perhaps more grateful for the second chance. <br>
			 Some may need a little more support, love, and patience at first, but dogs are incredibly resilient,<br>
			 and they adapt quickly to new environments. Dogs rescued from even terrible circumstances can transition into a well-adjusted member of your family.<br>
			 Working with a organization like Worthy Dog Rescue can offer valuable insight on the dog you are adopting.<br>
			 Our dogs are fostered by a member of our volunteer team, living in their home as part of a family.<br>
			 This intimate connection with the dog gives us a better sense of their personality<br>
			 and temperament, and helps us understand the type of adoptive home that will best suit them.<br>
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 Helping those in need is an enriching experience, and that goes for our four-legged friends<br>
			 as well as our neighbors. Worthy Dog Rescue works to give forgotten dogs a second chance at life,<br>
			  and we want adopters to help spread the word about the virtues of rescue <br>
			  so that others will consider the incredible good and personal <br>
			  satisfaction that comes from saving a dog's life.<br>
