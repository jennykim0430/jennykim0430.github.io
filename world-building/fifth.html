	How to Become a Real Family </h1>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3 style="text-align: right;">
		At Battersea, we make every effort to match you with the best animal for you.<br>
		That's why we look at everything from your living situation to your preferences.<br>
		 Because getting it right leads to something very special.
		 <br>
		 <br>

		As our dogs have individual characters, behaviours and needs,<br>
		you might not find an animal to rehome from us. But if that's the case,<br>
		we offer plenty of guidance to help you continue your search beyond Battersea.<br>
	</h3>
	 <br>

	<p style="text-align: right;">
			If you'd like to rehome a dog, please register with us.<br>

		We've been placing rescue pets with new owners for 160 years,<br>
		 which means we have a lot of experience. If you rehome an animal with Battersea, <br>
		 we'll guide you through every step of the process.<br>
		 <br>

		We ask that you keep an open mind and see the registration form as a way of<br>
		 telling us that you're interested in rehoming, not making an application for a specific animal.<br>
		  Every rescue at Battersea has a unique character, quirks and lots of love<br>
		   to give - and it's our job to help you find the one that's perfect for you, your home and your lifestyle.<br>
		   <br>

		Battersea relies upon donations to raise the vital funds needed to keep our centres running,<br> 
		and we need the continued support of the public to ensure we<br>
		 can continue to be here for every dog and cat. If you can help, please make a donation.<br>

	<h4 style="text-align: center;">
	STEP ONE: REGISTER</h4>

	<p style="text-align: center;">
		Before we can match you with a dog, you will need to register your details and answer a few<br>
	 questions related to your current living circumstances as well as your preferences.<br>
	  As you progress through the registration form, we will share additional information<br>
	   that will help you better understand why it might take us longer, or in some cases why<br>
	    it might not be possible, to find you a dog. We use our 160 years' of rehoming experience<br>
	     to match you with your perfect pet, which is why we encourage people to not apply<br>
	      for a specific animal as, chances are, we might be able to find you an even more suitable dog.<br>
			he form should take no more than 15 minutes and will help us find a dog that's right for you.<br>
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4 style="text-align: center;">
	STEP TWO: RECEIVE AUTOMATED REPLY</h4>

	<p style="text-align: center;">
		To ensure successful matches between people and pets, we use a combination of extensive<br>
		 rehoming experience, our staff expertise and analytical tools. After registering,<br> 
		 you will receive an automated response from us with an indication of your<br>
		  likeliness to rehome based on what you've told us, as well as the next steps of the process.<br>
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>

		<h4 style="text-align: center;">
	STEP THREE: LEAVE IT WITH US</h4>

	<p style="text-align: center;">
		Making good matches between people and pets is the most important thing to us,<br>
		 but it can take time. So if you don't hear from us for a while, rest assured<br>
		  that in this time we're busy caring for our dogs and cats and ensuring each one<br>
		   gets the best possible chance of happiness in a new home.<br>
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>

	<h4 style="text-align: center;">
	STEP FOUR: SPEAK WITH A REHOMING TEAM MEMBER</h4>

	<p style="text-align: center;">
		When we think there's a good chance we can find you a match,<br>
		 we will contact you to arrange a call. One of our expert rehoming<br>
		  team will then get in touch to chat about a few more details.<br>


		</p>
		<br>

		<h4 style="text-align: center;">
	STEP FIVE: REHOME </h4>

	<p style="text-align: center;">
		If we find you a match, you'll be able to virtually meet your potential<br>
		new dog through watching footage we've filmed of them at our centres<br> 
		 or in their foster homes or through a video call. This is where your new friendship begins!
		 <br> 

		Then we'll arrange a visit to a Battersea centre or deliver your new dog <br> 
		where possible upon request. We know that rehoming a pet is an exciting and<br> 
		emotional experience, so we'll give you plenty of expert<br> 
		pet advice and support to help your new dog settle in.
