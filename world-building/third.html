					<h2>Donate and Sponsor a Dog Kennel Today</h2>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
								<p>  By sponsoring a Dog Kennel, you are helping vulnerable dogs that arrive at our gates every day with nowhere else to turn, whatever their circumstance or history. You will be providing them with the best level of care, urgent medical treatment and safe shelter for as long as it takes until they find a new loving home. If you choose to sponsor a Dog Kennel today, we will send you your welcome folder containing your very own Dog Kennel Sponsorship certificate through the post. You'll also receive regular updates from your Kennel to meet the dogs you'll be helping and see how your support is making a difference. Sponsor a Dog Kennel today and your welcome pack should be with you in around two weeks' time.</p>
