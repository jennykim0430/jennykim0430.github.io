					<h2>How to Become a Real Family</h2>
					<br>
					<h4>At Battersea, we make every effort to match you with the best animal for you. That's why we look at everything from your living situation to your preferences. Because getting it right leads to something very special. As our dogs have individual characters, behaviours and needs, you might not find an animal to rehome from us. But if that's the case, we offer plenty of guidance to help you continue your search beyond Battersea.</h4>
					<br>
					<br>
					<h5> [ STEP ONE: REGISTER ]
					<br>
					<br>
					Before we can match you with a dog, you will need to register your details and answer a few
						questions related to your current living circumstances as well as your preferences.
						As you progress through the registration form, we will share additional information
						that will help you better understand why it might take us longer, or in some cases why
						it might not be possible, to find you a dog.</h5>
					<h5> [ STEP TWO: RECEIVE AUTOMATED REPLY ]
					<br>
					<br>
					To ensure successful matches between people and pets, we use a combination of extensive
					rehoming experience, our staff expertise and analytical tools. After registering,
					you will receive an automated response from us with an indication of your
					likeliness to rehome based on what you've told us, as well as the next steps of the process.</h5>

					<h5> [ STEP THREE: LEAVE IT WITH US]
					<br>
					<br>
					Making good matches between people and pets is the most important thing to us,
					but it can take time. So if you don't hear from us for a while, rest assured
					that in this time we're busy caring for our dogs and cats and ensuring each one
					gets the best possible chance of happiness in a new home.

</h5>

					<h5> [ STEP FOUR: SPEAK WITH A REHOMING TEAM MEMBER ]
					<br>
					<br>
					When we think there's a good chance we can find you a match,
					we will contact you to arrange a call. One of our expert rehoming
					team will then get in touch to chat about a few more details.</h5>

					<h5> [ STEP FIVE: REHOME ]
					<br>
					<br>
					If we find you a match, you'll be able to virtually meet your potential
					new dog through watching footage we've filmed of them at our centres
					or in their foster homes or through a video call. This is where your new friendship begins! 
					Then we'll arrange a visit to a Battersea centre or deliver your new dog 
					where possible upon request. We know that rehoming a pet is an exciting and
					emotional experience, so we'll give you plenty of expert
					pet advice and support to help your new dog settle in.</h5>
