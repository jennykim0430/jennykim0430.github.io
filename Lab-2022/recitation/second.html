  <p>Abandoned and stray animals are facing many problems that can expose them to disease, injury, and death due to urbanization. Rising real estate does not provide space for the excluded and displaced animals. They can find few shelters or roofs to rest and shelter from the rain and have no access to daily food and water. Air and noise pollution are causing health problems for the animals due to a reduction in green open spaces and an increase in construction activity. Air pollutants from traffic, cigarettes, and indoor infrastructure can weaken their immune systems, making them vulnerable to disease and causing organ damage. Noisy traffic noise and bright city lights can frighten animals. This environment makes them impatient, scared, and restless. They are more likely to be disturbed by loud human noises and crowds.

  <blockquote>"Compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character, and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to animals cannot be a good man.” <br>
  	 <br>
  -Arthur Schopenhauer, ‘On The Basis Of Morality,’ 1840.</blockquote>
   <br>
  <p>We need to find better solutions for animals and give them a better environment. This is not only helping the animals, but also helping people find a balance between the two. </p>
