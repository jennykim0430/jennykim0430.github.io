    <h1>Klimt : The Kiss</h1>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Love, intimacy, and sexuality are common themes found in Gustav Klimt's works. The Stoclet Frieze and the Beethoven Frieze are such examples of Klimt's focus on romantic intimacy. Both works are precursors to The Kiss and feature the recurring motif of an embracing couple. It is thought that Klimt and his companion Emilie Flöge modeled for the work, but there is no evidence or record to prove this. Others suggest the female was the model known as 'Red Hilda'; she bears strong resemblance to the model in his Woman with feather boa, Goldfish and Danaë.</p>

        <h2>A Closer Look at The Kiss</h2>
        <p>The embracing couple takes center stage in this composition, with a dark and flat golden background framing them on either side. At the feet of the couple, we can see the edge of a flowery meadow beneath the woman’s bare feet. A flowing yellow dress decorated with organic floral patterns and circular shapes encapsulates the woman. The florals continue into her hair, and the man wears a crown of ivy. A similarly colored robe with subtle swirls and geometric patterns is draped over the man’s shoulders.

We cannot see the face of the man as he is bent over, cradling the woman’s face between his hands and kissing her on the cheek. The woman’s eyes are softly closed, with her face turned up towards the kiss and her one arm draping around his neck.

Some historians have argued that this composition may capture the kiss between Apollo and Daphne in the Greek myth, Metamorphoses. Although Daphne transformed into a laurel tree to escape the love of Apollo, he still embraces her. Perhaps the abundance of flowers on the female figure is a nod to this story? The woman’s bare feet are planted on the earth, and delicate golden threads appear to be holding her to it.
Other historians have suggested that The Kiss reflects the moment when Orpheus turns to caress his love Eurydice as he loses her forever, from the tale of Eurydice and Orpheus. Many cite the slightly translucent appearance of the woman’s face as evidence for this interpretation.

        <h2>The Price</h2>
        <p>
         The price paid for The Kiss painting by the Austrian government was both record-breakingly high and an incredible bargain. When the Austrian government bought The Kiss from Klimt before he finished it, they paid a record-breaking 25,000 crowns for the painting. Today, this sum translates to around $240,000. In terms of the art market today, this price may not seem that impressive. Before this sale, however, 500 crowns was the record for the most expensive painting.

         Although the price was high in the early 20th century, it is relatively paltry today. The Kiss is an Austrian national treasure, and it is unlikely that the Viennese museum would ever consider selling it. If it were to be put on auction, it is likely that The Kiss would once again break sales records. In 2006, Klimt’s portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for $135 million, and at that time, it was the highest price ever paid for a painting. We can only imagine what The Kiss would be worth at auction today.
