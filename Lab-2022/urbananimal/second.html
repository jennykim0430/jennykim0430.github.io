  <p>Abandoned and stray animals are facing many problems that can expose them to disease, injury, and death due to urbanization. Rising real estate does not provide space for the excluded and displaced animals. They can find few shelters or roofs to rest under and shelter from the rain and have limited access to daily food and water. Air and noise pollution are causing health problems for the animals due to a reduction in green open spaces and an increase in construction activity. Air pollutants from traffic, cigarettes, and building construction can weaken their immune systems, making them vulnerable to disease and causing organ damage. Noisy traffic noise and bright city lights can frighten animals. This environment makes them impatient, scared, and restless. They are more likely to be disturbed by loud human noises and crowds. Animal’s living environment worsens as cities grow. Humans need to provide a better environment for animals to settle and live in.

  <blockquote>"Compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character, and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to animals cannot be a good man.” <br>
  	 <br>
  -Arthur Schopenhauer, ‘On The Basis Of Morality,’ 1840.</blockquote>

  <p>One key method for designing solutions that would aid the stray dogs and cats issue would be sheltered. From common sense, shelters run with short funds. So where do shelters raise their money? Only a few of the shelters receive government funding. And the adoption fee only covers a limited amount. So most of the shelters run based on donations, which is an uncertain income. </p>
