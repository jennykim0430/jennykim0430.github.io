					<h2>Concept</h2>
					<p>  I’v always thought that internet is one of the most important method to communicate and share different kinds of thoughts with all other people around the world. 
					If I had to choose an online space that I inhabit to call home, it would be my google drive. I’ve started to use google drive since 2010, which shows it contains countless memories and “I”s. Based on this idea, I decided to make a chat-bot, which can communicate with me to find photos and essays from the past easily, quickly.</p>

					<h2>Process</h2>

					<p>
						First of all, 
						<ul>
							<li>I used "Figma" to express my idea. It was my first time using figma but, it was good enough to follow through.</li>
							<br>
							<li> I picked iphone frame to set up and had made icons such as, text boxes and robot faces to create my google chat-bot.</li>
							<br>
							<li>After instering all the .pngs and .imgs, I started to type texts to look like a real chat.</li> 
							<br>
							<li>Lastly, I screenshotted few images and essays to organize so that it look like my chat bot has sent messages. </li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						It was really hard for me to finish this project because I am not a person who is really friendly with creating new apps or making videos. While other classmates were enjoying and expert at certain area, I was not. However, it was good chance for me to try something new and learn from others by watching their processes each week. Also, I felt like it would be great if there is a system like this google chat bot.
